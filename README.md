# Twine-Minigame-2

## Devlog

In my minigame, I designed the branching options to where the player's life depends on whether they can answer the given questions correctly. For example, in the first question, if the player chooses correct number of dots on the dice, they will be able to move on to the next question. However, if they choose the incorrect number of dots on the dice, they will die and be forced to loop back and retry the question until they get it right. This same process is repeated for the second question as well, but the question and answer choices are different. The third question however, is slightly different from the other two since the player is given an impossible question, instead, they are given three actions they can take in order to survive which is where I utilized the looping mechanism again. If the player chooses the option to either attempt the question or attack Braun, they will die and be sent back to try a different method where they will continue to die and loop back until they finally choose to befriend Braun, leading them to the conclusion of the game.



My thought process behind my design was to create a quiz-like game where it relies on the player's knowledge in order to proceed. I also wanted to create a tense atmosphere that would encourage players to really think hard and select their choices wisely while also implementing elements that were able to give the sinister mood some humor!
